# Angular 2 Starter Template

This is a starter template for Angular 2 applications for future use, so we can start building apps on the new platform from off-the-shelf.

#### Just run the following commands to get your app running
<code>npm install</code> will install the necessary packages for you to get started with Angular 2. Then, just run <code>npm start</code> and the server will start running on <code>localhost:3000</code> along with auto-reload on browsers and constant watching for changes.
